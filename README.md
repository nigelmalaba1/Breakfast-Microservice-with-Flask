# Cloud Continuous Delivery of Flask Microservice 
Breakfast Menu Web App using Flask Microservice

## Command Line Steps

Create virtualenv 'python3 -m venv <name_of_virtual_environment>'

Install: Run 'make install'

Run the app: 'python3 app.py'

## Project Summary 

in this project, I created a Microservice app in Flask and configured a Build System to Deploy changes. 

I used IaC *(Infrastructure as Code)* to deploy code in AWS App Runner.

This microservice generates a nutritious breakfast menu according to the user's inputs. The service will suggest appropriate food options considering factors such as the user's level of fatigue and the day of the week, for example if the user is tired, the microservie will recommend coffee and other items that will help the user becoem more focused throughout the day. The goal of the microservice is to eliminate the need to make a daily breakfast decision and free up the user's time and energy for more important matters.
